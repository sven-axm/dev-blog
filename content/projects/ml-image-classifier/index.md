An end-to-end machine learning project that demonstrates practical deep learning workflows. The system includes data preprocessing pipelines, custom CNN architectures, and deployment-ready inference code.

## Highlights

- Custom convolutional neural network architectures
- Transfer learning with pre-trained models (ResNet, EfficientNet)
- Data augmentation and preprocessing pipelines
- Model evaluation and visualization tools
- Flask-based web interface for real-time predictions

Built during my exploration of computer vision, this project showcases the complete ML lifecycle from data collection to model deployment. The modular design makes it easy to adapt for different classification tasks.
