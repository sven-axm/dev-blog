A high-performance rendering engine that showcases modern graphics programming techniques. Built from the ground up using the Vulkan API, this project demonstrates my expertise in low-level graphics programming and performance optimization.

## Features

- Physically Based Rendering (PBR) pipeline
- Real-time shadow mapping and global illumination
- Compute shader-based particle systems
- Multi-threaded command buffer generation
- Cross-platform support (Windows, Linux, macOS)

This project serves as both a learning platform and a foundation for future graphics projects. The codebase emphasizes clean architecture, extensive documentation, and performance-first design principles.
