A production-ready API gateway designed to handle routing, authentication, and rate limiting for microservices architectures. Built with Go for optimal performance and concurrency.

## Capabilities

- Dynamic routing and service discovery
- JWT-based authentication and authorization
- Rate limiting with Redis backend
- Request/response transformation
- Health checks and circuit breakers
- Comprehensive logging and monitoring

This project demonstrates understanding of distributed systems concepts, including service discovery, load balancing, and fault tolerance. The gateway is designed to be lightweight and highly concurrent, leveraging Go's strengths in network programming.
