Hey there! I'm Sven, a developer, tech enthusiast, and professional Googler of error messages.  
    I spend my days writing code, breaking code, and then pretending I meant to do that. My expertise lies in computer graphics with focus on the Vulkan API, C++, C#/.NET and machine learning (Python).  
    This blog is where I share my journey through the ever-evolving world of development and what I learned and discovered on the way.  
    When I’m not coding, you can find me making music, playing video games or on the way to a rollercoaster I haven't been on yet.
